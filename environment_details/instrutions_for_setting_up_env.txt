Before starting, make sure you went to https://github.com/NCAR/ncar-python-tutorial#step-2-install-miniconda-and-create-environments and completed steps 1 through 3.

Also, make sure you activate your conda environment containing the packages needed for this work antarctica_som_env within the drop down menu located in the top right of this notebook.

After environment was set up, from Cheyenne command line you can see what it takes to recreate environment by doing the following:
1. From cheyenne command line, activate environment:
> conda activate antarctica_som_env

2. To get a list of human readable packages, once you have the environment activated do the following:
> conda list >> conda_list.txt
The results of this command are in the file called "conda_list.txt" in this directory. But the normal output is just at the command line if you don't specify the text file to write to. 

3. Then you can export the environment as a yml file:
> conda env export --from-history > environment.yml

4. To recreate the python environment, do the following:
> conda env create -f environment.yml -n new_env_name
